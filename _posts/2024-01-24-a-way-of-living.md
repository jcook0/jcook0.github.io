> "It's not the destination, it's the journey" 
	- Ralph Waldo Emerson
	
You've probably seen this quote before. Recently, it has really stuck with me because of its meaning. 

I used to believe "If I could earn X amount of money, then I'd finally be happy" or "If I could get through X, I'd be happy." However, there is a profound flaw with this mindset. Happiness is not a tangible pursuit. We have moments of happiness, but it always comes and goes. Similarly, we experience joy one day but feel sadness the next. Unfortunately, there is no way to permanently alter our mood/emotional state (at least for now; see [wireheading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirehead_(science_fiction))). 

In modern times, we often artificially manipulate our emotions in order to make us feel how we want immediately. Whether it's cheering ourselves up after a gloomy day by watching YouTube, seeking lust through pornography, or using alcohol and drugs to suppress worries, we seek instanteous self-gratification. While these activities might be fine in moderation, they can easily become problematic when we ignore their reality. They do not serve our well-being; they are acts to satisfy our emotional desires, and indulging in them only grows such desires insatiably.

So instead of living in the pursuit of happiness, we should seek the Truth at every moment. Truth is based on reality and objectivity in the world. Truth is the experiences we have, what we know deep down, and the things we do. It serves as the best self-evident reference point for viewing our lives. Detaching ourselves from the world leads to a loss of grip on the Truth.

 Perhaps, a truly "happy" life is where one consistently follows their Truth.
