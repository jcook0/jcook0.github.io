## The Hacker Attitude

- The world is full of interesting problems waiting to be solved.
- No problem should be solved twice. There are cases where it has educational benefit.
- Boredom and drudgery are evil. 
- (Software) freedom is good. Authoritarianism is bad.
- Competence and rationality is everything.
- Crackers are idiotic and should be disdained.
